# creditcard-checker

**Creditcard checker** is a script, which is written in JavaScript, and its purpose is to identify the invalid creditcard from the valid ones.

It uses the famous **Luhn Algorithm** to identify the invalid creditcards.
It is a practice of implementing the Luhn Algotihm in JavaScript, for improving myself with the JavaScript syntax.
